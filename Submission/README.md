# VBA-challenge
This is the repository for the Module 2 homework focusing on VBA in the Data Analytics Boot Camp

Our intructions were to "Create a script that loops through all the stocks for each quarter and outputs:

1. The ticker symbol

2. Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter

3. The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter

4. The total stock volume of the stock

5. The "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume"

6. Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every quarter) at once.

Much of the code is pulled directly from our instructor's, Alexander Booth.

The code that is my own is when I figured out how to apply a color conditional to the percent change.

For the section on coding the greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease, and greatest total volume, I received instruction from the tutor Khangwelo Maphanda. He was very patient and helphelpful.

The most useful experience was when I had to retype the code when certain sections were lost upon closing out of Excel. I also had to go through the VBA code line by line to make the script run on each worksheet. This helped me get used to the syntax of VBA. VBA is still difficult, but I have a much better understanding of it.

On the whole, this Module Challenge helped me appreciate the importance of logic and sytax. I am still very new to the world of coding. Looking forward to playing around more with VBA and Excel.
